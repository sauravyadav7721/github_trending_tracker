## 🧠 What This Project Does

This project acts like a **smart robot** 🤖 that visits GitHub’s Trending page, collects the list of popular repositories, and saves their details — such as **name, stars, language, and description**.

It then stores this data in a **SQLite database** for analysis and generates **beautiful visualizations** (like bar charts) showing which programming languages are trending the most.
